# probability-simulator-toolkit
Tool that allows you to simulate all sorts of probability distributions (including your owns). 

You may use them to illustrate multiple probability theory results including but not limited to : 
  - Wigner's semi-circle law for gaussian matrices
  - Central Limit Theorem
  - Polya Urns
  - Law of large numbers
  - The structure of cycles theorem
  - Random Walks in 1D, 2D and 3D
  - Law of the middle for urns
  - Random graphs (WIP)
  - The Salem-Zygmund theorem (WIP)
  - Number of fixed points
  - Bernstein polynomials approach to Weierstrass' theorem
  - Law duels (WIP)
etc...

The goal of this project is to build intuition on probability by truly understanding how each probability law and their parameters function all whilst discovering theorems and probability problems. 
Being able to apply these problems and theorems to different laws of probability is truly interesting as most theorems reside in their universality.

In the future, I plan on adding:
  - Finish adding the possibility to create your own law of probability
  - More illustrations of probability problems.
  - More illustrations of probability theorems people are usually unfamiliar with.
  - Illustrations of processes, brownian motion, stochastic calculus, measure theory etc...
  - More law duels (ie games where you go up against an opponent and have to select probability distributions wisely to win).
  - GUI once all is finished.
